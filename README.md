# Self Adapting Wave Patterns

This project was based on the article ‘Self Adapting Non-Linear Wave Patterns’, which was written by David A. Kessler and Herbert Levine, and published in the New Journal of Physics on December 16th 2016.

I was able to find the steady state solution with the Euler method. It took 100 million time steps. The initial conditions used were simply rectangular. Periodic boundary conditions were also required.
